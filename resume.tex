%	SUMMARY SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Summary}
  I am an engineer with experience building large-scale distributed backend
  systems looking for an opportunity to work in a high performance team
  comprised of industry thought leaders and high potential engineers. My career
  focus has been on low-latency, high throughput systems and I have a proven
  track record of developing and bringing successful systems to production.

%	WORK EXPERIENCE SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Experience}

  \begin{rSubsection}{Amazon Web Services}{May, 2018 - Present}{Sr. Big Data Consultant}{New York, NY}
  \item \textbf{\textit{Professional Services}} Help customers adopt
    AWS and migrate from existing on-premises data centers.  I focus on Big
    Data problems helping customers build serverless data lakes using AWS Glue,
    EMR, and S3.  I also work with customers building streaming applications
    leveraging Amazon Kinesis and Apache Spark Streaming.

  \end{rSubsection}
  %-----------------------------------------------

  \begin{rSubsection}{Movable Ink}{August, 2015 - May, 2018}{Senior Engineer}{New York, NY}
  \item \textbf{\textit{Signals}} Architected and implemented real-time distributed systems for ingesting and processing behavioral data for content creation and display. System comprised of microservices written in Golang and streaming batch processing in Spark Streaming.
  \item \textbf{\textit{Data Engineering}} Migrated daily ETL jobs for cleaning data and generating reports from legacy single-threaded processes to Spark and Hive. Processing time for one business-critical job was reduced from 40 hours to 10 minutes.
  \item \textbf{\textit{Backend Infrastructure}} Made extensive use of AWS EMR and EC2 in getting these systems off the ground. Also introduced Docker for development and testing of our applications. 


  \end{rSubsection}
  %-----------------------------------------------

  \begin{rSubsection}{HookLogic}{March, 2014 - July, 2015}{Data Platform Engineer}{New York, NY}
  \item \textbf{\textit{Streaming Data Pipeline}} Migrated existing batch data pipeline (in Hadoop MR and Hive) to be streaming using Apache Storm, Golang, and Amazon Kinesis.  Pipeline has multiple topologies handling over 20MBps of data ingested.  Changes reduced ledger latency from 20 minutes to a few seconds.  Development of project also involved incorporating Jenkins CI, Artifactory for private Maven JARs, and leveraging Docker for local end-to-end testing.
  \item \textbf{\textit{HBase Integration}} Incorporating HBase into data pipeline workflows with Hive and Hadoop for realtime querying and journaled data storage.
  \item \textbf{\textit{Backend Infrastructure}} Part of getting the above projects implemented involved spinning up clusters in Amazon EC2 as well as setting up VPCs and infrastructure monitoring.  

  \end{rSubsection}
  %-----------------------------------------------

  \begin{rSubsection}{Sailthru}{November, 2011 - February, 2014}{Developer}{New York, NY}
  \item \textbf{Backend Development} Most of my time at Sailthru was spent as a member of the Backend development team which involved improving our custom emailing software, templating software, job processing, and user data querying tools. This work was done in PHP, Java, and used MongoDB and HBase for data storage.
  \end{rSubsection}

  %------------------------------------------------

  \begin{rSubsection}{Lockheed Martin}{June, 2008 - November, 2011}{Associate Engineer}{Mitchel Field, NY / Manassas, VA}
  \item \textbf{\textit{US Navy Systems}} Helped incorporate DoD information security requirements into next-generation submarine navigator. A lot of my time in this role involved interfacing with the multiple Navy customers we had to get them in agreement with our design decisions. I also worked on prototyping a secure edge networking interface. Part of an earlier role involved data storage system tasks including implementation of XML-based data parser for sonar data. Lastly, I spent time analyzing and fixing kernel panics in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.
  \item \textbf{\textit{Engineering Leadership Development Program}} Selected
    as part of a group of young engineers to build leadership abilities through
    additional education and project work. Wrote white paper on novel sonar
    system and helped with R\&D as part of winning grant from LM.
