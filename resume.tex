\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Sailthru}{November, 2011 - Present}{Developer}{New York, NY}
\item \textbf{\textit{Query}} Fleshed out query tool for segmenting clients' profiles (users) using a variety of criteria based off of client-submitted as well as Sailthru-derived data. I also ported the original PHP variant into more a efficient Java version while maintaining all existing functionality and adding new features.
\item \textbf{\textit{Campaign Generation}} Implemented many performance and feature improvements to campaign generation code.  Using the Java Query code I developed to convert old PHP version into a managed Java process.
\item \textbf{\textit{Campaign Statistics}} Improved legacy campaign statistics performance by up to 70\% by investigating and refactoring unnecessary data movement and utilization. Designed and coordinated completely refactoring the old job-oriented statistics process into 'real-time' event-oriented statistics collection eliminating a previously unsightly and painful delay between campaign sending and initial statistics calculations.
\item \textbf{\textit{Development Sandbox}} Created one-line development environment creation/instantiation using Vagrant, Chef, and custom REST APIs as well as an automated backend database sanitization system to get new developers coding within an hour of getting access to Sailthru repos and facilities.
\item \textbf{\textit{Dev-Ops}} Part of my role within Sailthru involves investigating and planning software and system architecture, developing a wide variety of internal tools (like the sandbox above), as well as performing occasional spot maintenance and performance analysis of our existing infrastructure.

\begin{rSubsection}{Lockheed Martin}{June, 2008 - November, 2011}{Associate Engineer}{Mitchel Field, NY / Manassas, VA}
\item \textbf{\textit{Information Assurance}} Helped incorporate DoD information security requirements into next-generation submarine navigator.
\item \textbf{\textit{Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI)}} Worked on data storage system tasks including implementation of XML-based data parser for sonar data. Also analyzed and remedied kernel panics in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.
\item \textbf{\textit{Focused Acoustics Naval Tactical Array (FANTA)}} Project was a result of winning internal R\&D money based off of a white paper that I worked on with a few other young employees. Worked with 3 other young engineers to simulate, build, and test prototype for novel sonar device. Performed simulations using MATLAB and helped fabricate prototype. Project was performed during off-hours from ARCI.
\item \textbf{\textit{Engineering Leadership Development Program}} Selected as part of a group of young engineers to build leadership abilities through additional education and project work.
